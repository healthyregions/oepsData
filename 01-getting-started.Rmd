# Getting started

Installing `oepsData` is easy. Just run the following command to grab the newest release from GitHub.

```{r how to install, results=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')

devtools::install_github('https://github.com/healthyregions/oepsData')
```

You can then load the package like any other R package:

```{r}
library(oepsData)
```

Efforts are currently under way to list the package on CRAN.
