<p><code>oepsData</code> is centered around two functions: <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code>, which loads a basic data dictionary; and <code>load_oeps</code>, which directly loads OEPS data. We expect that most users will start by calling <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code> to look at what data is available at their desired analysis scale, followed by calling <code>load_oeps</code> to actually load the data.</p>
<p><code>load_oeps_dictionary</code> itself takes one argument – scale – that can be any of “tract”, “zcta”, “county”, or “state”. It returns the data dictionary (stored as a data.frame), so we recommend browsing it through the <code>View</code> command:</p>

<p><code>oepsData</code> pulls its data from online repositories, primarily GitHub. This can lead to issues for users operating on slow internet, for whom load times can be long for larger datasets, or for users who anticipate needing the package when entirely offline.</p>
<p>To help minimize these issues, <code>oepsData</code> caches, or saves a local copy of, data loaded by <code>load_oeps</code> on its first load. Additionally, <code>oepsData</code> offers a few commands can help maintain caches:
* <code>cache_geometries</code> and <code>cache_oeps_tables</code> cache all tables and geometries, overwriting prior ones in the process.
* <code>clear_cache</code> deletes all cached data.
* <code>cache_dir</code> returns the directory of the oepsData cache.</p>
<p>Users who want to avoid using cached data and instead download data fresh every time can set <code>cache=FALSE</code> when calling <code>load_oeps</code>.</p>
