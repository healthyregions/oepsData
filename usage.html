<p><code>oepsData</code> is centered around two functions: <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code>, which loads a basic data dictionary; and <code>load_oeps</code>, which directly loads OEPS data. We expect that most users will start by calling <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code> to look at what data is available at their desired analysis scale, followed by calling <code>load_oeps</code> to actually load the data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code><a href="usage.html#load_oeps_dictionary" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><code>load_oeps_dictionary</code> takes one argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>scale</code> One of “tract”, “zcta”, “county”, or “state”</li>
</ul>
<p>It returns the data dictionary (stored as a data.frame).</p>

<p>We might find that we’re interested in the 1990 state data. We can load that data and its geometries using <code>load_oeps</code>, which accepts the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>scale</code> The scale of analysis. One of “tract”, “zcta”, “county”, or “state”</p></li>
<li><p><code>year</code> The release year for the data. One of 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, or 2018.</p></li>
<li><p><code>themes</code> The theme to pull data for. One of ’Geography”, “Social”, “Environment”, “Economic”, “Policy”, “Composite”, or “All”. Defaults <code>All</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>states</code> A string or vector of strings specifying which states to pull data for, either as FIPS codes or names. Ignored when scale is in ZCTA. Defaults <code>None</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>counties</code> A string or vector of strings specifying which counties to pull data for, either as FIPS or names. Ignored for ZCTA, and must be specified alongside <code>states</code>. Defaults <code>None</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tidy</code> Boolean specifying whether to return data in tidy format; defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>geometry</code> Boolean specifying whether to pull geometries for the dataset. Defaults <code>FALSE</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>cache</code> Boolean specifying whether to use cahced geometries or not. Defaults <code>TRUE</code>. See <a href="usage.html#a-note-on-caching">A note on caching</a> for more information.</p></li>

<p><code>oepsData</code> pulls its data from online repositories, primarily GitHub. This can lead to issues for users operating on slow internet, for whom load times can be long for larger datasets, or for users who anticipate needing the package when entirely offline.</p>
<p>To help minimize these issues, <code>oepsData</code> caches, or saves a local copy of, data loaded by <code>load_oeps</code> on its first load. Any later usage of the dataset will be pulled from the local cache.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>oepsData</code> offers a few commands can help maintain caches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cache_geometries</code> and <code>cache_oeps_tables</code> will pre-cache all tables and geometries (it will overwrite existing cache content in the process).</li>
<li><code>clear_cache</code> deletes all cached data.</li>
<li><code>cache_dir</code> returns the directory of the <code>oepsData</code> cache.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users who want to avoid using cached data and instead download data fresh every time can set <code>cache=FALSE</code> when calling <code>load_oeps</code>.</p>
