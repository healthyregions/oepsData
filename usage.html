<p><code>oepsData</code> is centered around two functions: <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code>, which loads a basic data dictionary; and <code>load_oeps</code>, which directly loads OEPS data. We expect that most users will start by calling <code>load_oeps_dictionary</code> to look at what data is available at their desired analysis scale, followed by calling <code>load_oeps</code> to actually load the data.</p>
<div id="load_oeps_dictionary" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> load_oeps_dictionary<a href="usage.html#load_oeps_dictionary" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><code>load_oeps_dictionary</code> itself takes one argument — <code>scale</code> — that can be any of “tract”, “zcta”, “county”, or “state”. It returns the data dictionary (stored as a data.frame), so we recommend browsing it through the <code>View</code> command:</p>

<p>We might find that we’re interested in the 1990 state data. We can load that data and its geometries using <code>load_oeps</code>, which accepts the following arguments:
- <code>scale</code> The scale of analysis. One of “tract”, “zcta”, “county”, or “state”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>year</code> The release year for the data. One of 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, or 2018.</p></li>
<li><p><code>themes</code> The theme to pull data for. One of ’Geography”, “Social”, “Environment”, “Economic”, “Policy”, “Composite”, or “All”. Defaults <code>All</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>states</code> A string or vector of strings specifying which states to pull data for, either as FIPS codes or names. Ignored when scale is in ZCTA. Defaults <code>None</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>counties</code> A string or vector of strings specifying which counties to pull data for, either as FIPS or names. Ignored for ZCTA, and must be specified alongside <code>states</code>. Defaults <code>None</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tidy</code> Boolean specifying whether to return data in tidy format; defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>geometry</code> Boolean specifying whether to pull geometries for the dataset. Defaults <code>FALSE</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>cache</code> Boolean specifying whether to use cahced geometries or not. See the section on <a href="https://oepsdata.healthyregions.org/getting-started#cacheing">cacheing</a> for more. Defaults <code>TRUE</code>.</p></li>
