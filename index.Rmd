# Introduction

The Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS) is an open-source data warehouse created by the Healthy Regions & Policies Lab to support researchers in studying and modeling the opioid risk environment. This website is intended as a starting place for researchers interested in using the OEPS data.

On this site, we have tutorials demonstrating two methods of accessing the Policy Scan's data sets: first through an R package called `oepsData`, and secondly through `bigrquery`. We additionally provide a few example analyses using the data sets as a starting place for spatial research. 

To hear more on the project, check out the OEPS [website](https://oeps.healthyregions.org/). For more on the data itself, check out the in-depth [data documentation](https://oeps.healthyregions.org/docs) or the [online explorer](https://oeps.healthyregions.org/map).

```{r, include=FALSE}
install.packages('bigrquery')
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('DBI')
install.packages('sf')
install.packages('tmap')
```
