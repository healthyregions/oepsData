# Introduction

The Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS) is an open-source data warehouse created by the [Healthy Regions & Policies Lab](https://healthyregions.org/) to support researchers in studying and modeling the opioid risk environment. This website is intended as a starting place for researchers interested in using the OEPS data, especially using R.
