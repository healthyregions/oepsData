<p><code>load_data</code> offers a few tools to help subset data on first load. To get a better sense of how these tools can be put towards practical use, let’s walk through a quick and dirty spatial investigation of poverty and working age population in Chicago.</p>
<p>We start by loading the data dictionary to see what data is available and into what themes they are categorized. This lets us request a subset of the full data set, which minimizes the amount of data in our environment at a time.</p>

<p>Based on the data dictionary, we can see that we have two variables of interest – <code>Age18_64</code> and <code>PovP</code>. Both variables are available at multiple time periods, and they belong to different themes – social and economic, respectively.</p>
<p>Let’s pull our data using <code>load_oeps</code>. Note how many parameters we provide information for. Geographically, we provide the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt">FIPS code</a> for our desired <code>states</code> (just Illinois) and <code>counties</code> (just Cook), which dramatically cuts down the number of entries retrieved. Additionally, we provide our variables of interests’ themes, lowering the number of rows retrieved.</p>

<p>Based on the above, we observe that fewer working age individuals correlates roughly with higher poverty rates within the southern and western sides of Chicago, with this trend breaking down in northern suburbs.</p>
<p>Chicagoland continues a little bit into northeastern Indiana; maybe the rough correlation is present there as well? To check, we can pass a list of county <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html">GEOIDS</a> to the <code>counties</code> parameter of <code>load_oeps</code>. Note that these GEOIDS <em>must</em> consist of the state FIPS and county FIPS, as they would otherwise fail to uniquely identify our two counties.</p>

<p>We can once again map the resultant data, and find that the rough correlation between lower working age population totals and higher poverty in more densely populated, coastal areas seems to hold for the broader Chicagoland area.</p>

<p>Although not directly supported in the package, <code>oepsData</code> also enables easier longitudinal analysis. Continuing our above example, we might be interested in the change in percent poverty over time throughout Chicagoland. To check, let’s compare 2000 data to 2010 data.</p>
<p>We start by grabbing data from 2000:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="example-uses.html#cb11-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># get new data</span></span>

<span id="cb11-7"><a href="example-uses.html#cb11-7" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="at">geometry=</span>F)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>chicago_metro_2000</code> and <code>chicago_metro_2010</code> share column names, so we need to do some data wrangling for the merge. A wide variety of approaches exist, but we opt to use <code>dplyr</code> to select and rename our columns of interest.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="example-uses.html#cb12-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># rename data columns</span></span>

<p>We can then merge the dataframes. Provided with oepsData are a HEROP specific merge-key – <code>HEROP_ID</code> – and a more common <code>GEOID</code>. We recommend merging on <code>HEROP_ID</code> when merging HEROP data, and reserving <code>GEOID</code> for compatability with outside datasets.</p>

<p>With longitudinal data in hand, we can then conduct basic analyses on our data. For instance, we can make side-by-side maps of poverty rates:</p>
